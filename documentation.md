**instructions (delete grey parts before submitting):**
All work should be presented as a case study not just a series of pictures. 
Imagine a potential employer asking you to explain the thinking behind your work. A case study serves this purpose best. Interactions are small stories, sequences of events, just like the journey you undertook to develop a going solution, the user too is going on a journey while they are using your solution..
A  case study also allows for [**interaction design (UX) storytelling](https://blog.uxfol.io/ux-storytelling/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog&utm_content=ux-portfolio-template).** Like all good stories this one has a beginning a middle and an end.

Check out a sample case study by csueb alumn Princess Gaoaen at [http://www.gaoaendesign.com/pages/theafrofuturistpodcast.html](http://www.gaoaendesign.com/pages/theafrofuturistpodcast.html)

> “Every great design begins with an even better story.”
— Lorinda Mamo, Designer / Creative Director

# **Introduction:**

**The beginning** has two main objectives: draw attention and give context.  Get my attention . Use a big quote, or a big image. Visitors first see this when opening your project, so make a good impression. Then lead by answering the questions in good prose. No bullets, no long meaningless sentences either. Title , subtitle, one pithy paragraph.  

- Who was the client?
- Who was on your team?
- What role did you play?
- What was the challenge you faced?

The who, where, what, when, and save the why and how for the middle!

# Process:

**The middle** explains your process is the most difficult part to write. this is the meat of your case study.

Separate thoughts and topics with headings. This is called sign-posting and shows your skill in interaction and graphic design 

INSERT IMAGES OF YOUR PROCESS IN THIS PART

- 1.Discover (interviewing, sketching)
- 2. Protoyping & Testing (wireframes, models, and feedback)
- Design (what is the final result)

Headings allow readers to quickly scan text and decide whether to read your case study. 

Headings should attract attention and cover the content below.

# Conclusion

**The end s**hows the result and takeaways.  Leave your visitors with the feeling that you are a problem-solver and that you got results. [**Here is a good example](https://www.uxfol.io/collection/abdd089d-b8c3-4a0b-bfa5-41b81021cb27/project/5ad5e42c7d444800044700b8/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog) of this idea.**

How many interviews?

How many usability Tests?

How many iterations/versions?

Do you have metrics that you can share? 

Can you quantify the result?

How many hits? Downloads? New Users? Was there a measurable increase or decrease in a key measure?

## Project Reflection:

(250 words – reflective writing –What was the most challenging part? What was the most exciting part now that the project is done? What did you learn in this assignment, what is your biggest takeaway?)
